> **Editable is already table stakes — what sets PPT Master apart is native depth.** It hands you a real PowerPoint: slide masters, native shapes, data-backed charts and tables — not flat text boxes, and not a filled-in template. It also does more than lay slides out nicely — it reasons the argument into shape first, then designs; and that native depth keeps **converging with PowerPoint itself**, adding more of its native capabilities release after release. In form, it's a workflow that runs inside any agent-capable AI tool: hand the AI your topic or material, and it generates on your machine — your data stays local, no platform or model lock-in.

Drop in your source material, and what you get back isn't a static layout you can edit — it's **a complete deck with real PowerPoint behavior**: native slide transitions, opt-in entrance / emphasis / motion-path / exit animations (off by default), speaker notes that can become audio narration and even video, charts and tables that can ship as real data-backed PowerPoint objects, and it can follow your own PPT template — present it as-is, and keep refining. How to use each capability → [Getting Started](./docs/getting-started.md).

## Product Positioning

**Editable is now table stakes — the real question is how much of PowerPoint you actually get.** PPT Master delivers PowerPoint's native object model itself, and in depth: native shapes and connectors with working adjustment handles, data-backed charts and tables on demand, and the full text / picture / fill / effect model — click any element and keep editing it as a native PowerPoint object; and through the template / structured route, it can hand you a deck with real slide masters and layouts (`p:sldMaster` / `p:sldLayout` inheritance).

And that depth is a **direction of travel, not a fixed checklist.** PPT Master's north star is to keep converging with PowerPoint itself: an ongoing effort to build and integrate more of PowerPoint's native capabilities, release after release, closing the gap between what an AI can generate for you and what you could build by hand in PowerPoint. The [PowerPoint ↔ SVG Mapping Guide](./docs/powerpoint-svg-mapping.md) is the honest, feature-by-feature record of how far that reaches today — and SmartArt is a deliberate omission, not a gap.

In form, it's a workflow (a "skill") that runs inside any agent-capable AI tool: tell it in chat — "make a deck from this PDF" — and it runs the workflow on your machine and exports a natively editable `.pptx`. No coding on your side; you do exactly three things — install Python, install an AI tool, drop in your material.

Generating a new deck from source documents is the main pipeline, but not the only route. PPT Master can also distill reusable brand / style / layout / deck templates from your references, fill an existing `.pptx` with new content while preserving its design, and add native transitions, animations, and narration to a finished deck — each route with an explicit contract for what gets preserved.

On top of that native depth, this form comes with three promises:

- **Transparent, predictable cost** — free and open source; the only cost is your AI model usage, with no PPT subscription on top
- **Data stays local** — apart from AI model communication, the entire pipeline runs on your machine
- **No platform lock-in** — any agent-capable AI IDE can drive it; Claude, GPT, Gemini, Kimi, and other models all work

Why you'd choose it, and where it isn't the right fit → [Why PPT Master](./docs/why-ppt-master.md); the long-term capability boundaries behind these promises → [Project Positioning](./docs/project-positioning.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### This is a tool, not a wishing well
> `harness + model = agent` — PPT Master only owns the workflow; the model sets the ceiling. Recommended: **Kimi K3 (or Claude) with a large context window (~1M tokens) + AI image generation (`gpt-image-2` or Google `gemini-3.1-flash-image`)**; other models can run the pipeline, with a quality gap.
>
> And don't expect a finished, perfect deck in one shot. The tool's value is taking most of the tedious work off your plate; the polishing that's left is yours — a natively editable deck exists precisely so you can keep working on it, not a flat image you can't touch. The cheaper the model, the more there is to do; if results disappoint, upgrade the model first, then check your usage against [Getting Started](./docs/getting-started.md) and the [example projects](https://hugohe3.github.io/ppt-master-examples/).

## Built by Hugo He

I'm a finance professional (CPA · CPV · Consulting Engineer (Investment)) who regularly reviews and edits presentation decks. I wanted AI-generated slides to remain editable in PowerPoint, not flattened into images — so I built this.

Knowing how to use Python and AI agents will matter more and more, and this project is also meant to show how far you can go with just those two things. There's a learning curve if you're starting cold, but it's the curve worth climbing — making a deck is just the excuse; what I'm really pushing is Python and agents.

## Quick Start

### 1. Prerequisites

**All you need to install is [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.10+.** Everything else comes with one line — `pip install -r requirements.txt` — after you download the project in Step 3.

<details>
<summary><strong>Windows</strong> — see the dedicated <a href="./docs/windows-installation.md">step-by-step guide</a> ⚠️</summary>

Windows requires a few extra steps (PATH setup, execution policy, etc.). We wrote a **step-by-step guide** specifically for Windows users:

**📖 [Windows Installation Guide](./docs/windows-installation.md)** — from zero to a working presentation in 10 minutes.

Quick version: download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) → **check "Add to PATH"** during install → done; dependencies are installed in Step 3.
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>macOS / Linux</strong> — install and go</summary>

```bash
# macOS
brew install python

# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
```
</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Edge-case fallback</strong> — 99% of users don't need this</summary>

**Pandoc** — only needed for legacy document formats: `.doc`, `.odt`, `.rtf`, `.tex`, `.rst`, `.org`, or `.typ`. `.docx`, `.html`, `.epub`, `.ipynb` are handled natively by Python — no pandoc required.

```bash
# macOS
brew install pandoc

# Ubuntu / Debian
sudo apt install pandoc
```
</details>

### 2. Pick an Agent

PPT Master runs in **any tool with agent capability** — read/write files, execute commands, and sustain multi-turn conversation.

Never used one of these? Don't worry — in this project they play exactly one role: an AI chat window that can read and write files. Pick any tool from the table, install it, and you'll only ever use its chat panel. No coding involved.

> **Author's pick: [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)** — the environment this project is developed and tested on most thoroughly, as the CLI or the VS Code / JetBrains extension.

| Type | Examples | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **IDE-native agent** | • VS Code architecture ([VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) itself, plus forks & derivatives): [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/), Trae, Codebuddy IDE, [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf), etc.<br>• Other architectures: [Zed](https://zed.dev/), etc. | Editor with a built-in agent |
| **IDE plugin / extension** | [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) (VS Code / JetBrains extension), [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot), [Cline](https://cline.bot/), etc. | Installed inside hosts like VS Code or JetBrains |
| **CLI agent** | [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) CLI, [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex), Gemini CLI, etc. | Runs in the terminal; suits scripting, remote, or server use |

> **Model recommendation**: for the best results, use **[Kimi K3](https://www.kimi.com/code/?aff=ppt-master)** (or Claude) to drive the pipeline, paired with AI image generation — **`gpt-image-2`** (OpenAI) or **`gemini-3.1-flash-image`** (Google). Kimi Code, the project sponsor, is a great pick for pay-as-you-go access.

**🔑 Want to use Claude / GPT / Gemini but don't have access yet?** Project sponsors **[PackyCode](https://www.packyapi.ai/register?aff=ppt-master)**, **[APIKEY.FUN](https://apikey.fun/register?aff=PPT-MASTER)** and **[RunAPI](https://runapi.host/register?aff=WMLJ)** offer pay-as-you-go access to Claude, GPT, Gemini and more — no subscription required, with exclusive discounts for our users (details at the top of this page).

**🔀 Juggling several providers?** Once you hold keys from more than one of them, [cc-switch](https://github.com/farion1231/cc-switch) — a cross-platform desktop app — lets you one-click switch API providers for Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI and more, no manual config editing.

### 3. Set Up

**Option A — Git clone** (recommended; requires [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed): the preferred path, since a clone can pull the latest version at any time.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hugohe3/ppt-master.git
cd ppt-master
```

Then install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Option B — Download ZIP** (no Git required; best for a quick trial): click **Code → Download ZIP** on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/hugohe3/ppt-master), then unzip, and install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. A ZIP has no Git history, so it can't `git pull` — see Updating Later. If that download is too large or fails, grab the skill-only package `ppt-master-skill-*.zip` (~56 MB, fully functional but without the bundled example decks) from the [Releases](https://github.com/hugohe3/ppt-master/releases) page instead.

#### Updating Later

**Git clone installs:**

```bash
python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/update_repo.py
```

The script pulls the latest version and syncs Python dependencies when `requirements.txt` changes.

**Download ZIP installs:**

ZIP folders do not include Git history, so they cannot run `git pull`. To update, download the latest ZIP, unzip it into a new folder, copy your old `.env` and `projects/` folder into the new folder, then run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Option C — Skill marketplace**: the repo ships `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, so it can be installed through the [Claude Code plugin marketplace](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/plugin-marketplaces) ecosystem:
>
> ```bash
> # Cross-agent CLI (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, etc.)
> npx skills add hugohe3/ppt-master
>
> # Or inside Claude Code
> /plugin marketplace add hugohe3/ppt-master
> /plugin install ppt-master@ppt-master
> ```
>
> Both install paths above only fetch the skill files (not the full repo); you still need to `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the installed location for the post-processing scripts to run.

### 4. Create

**First, open the project folder in your agent:** the goal is to point the AI at the `ppt-master` directory you unzipped / cloned in the previous step. In an IDE-type tool, use **File → Open Folder** — the AI chat panel is usually in the sidebar; in a CLI agent, `cd ppt-master` first, then launch it. Everything from here on happens in the chat.

**Provide source materials (recommended):** Place your PDF, DOCX, images, or other files in the `projects/` directory, then tell the AI chat panel which files to use. The quickest way to get the path: right-click the file in your file manager or IDE sidebar → **Copy Path** (or **Copy Relative Path**) and paste it directly into the chat.

```
You: Please create a PPT from projects/q3-report/sources/report.pdf
```

**Paste content directly:** You can also paste text content straight into the chat window and the AI will generate a PPT from it.

```
You: Please turn the following into a PPT: [paste your content here...]
```

By default—unless you explicitly request quick generation—the AI first confirms
the design spec:

```
AI:  Sure. Let's confirm the design spec:
     [Template] B) Free design
     [Format]   PPT 16:9
     [Pages]    8-10 pages
     ...
```

The AI handles everything — content analysis, visual design, SVG generation, and PPTX export.

**Quick generation (skip the confirmation round trip):** say so explicitly and the AI goes straight to authoring and export.

```
You: Quickly generate a 5-page deck from projects/q3-report/sources/report.pdf — no need to confirm with me
```

Whatever you state explicitly is followed; whatever you leave unspecified the agent decides on its own instead of asking. It still converts sources, fills factual gaps, applies the shared visual baseline, and uses images/icons/native shapes/charts/tables/PowerPoint-native inline or block formulas as needed — it drops interaction and durable planning, not presentation capability. It is one-pass and non-resumable, and there is no `svg_final/` preview. Full guide → [Quick mode](./docs/getting-started.md#quick-mode).

> **Output:** The SVG pipeline has one PPTX converter: it reads `svg_output/` and writes a directly editable native DrawingML deck to `exports/<name>_<timestamp>.pptx`. The default Generate flow runs `finalize_svg.py` and produces self-contained previews in `svg_final/`; PowerPoint's manual **Convert to Shape** command is outside the supported contract. Explicit [quick generation](./skills/ppt-master/workflows/profiles/quick-generate.md) skips Strategist, confirmation, `design_spec.md`, `spec_lock.md`, and `finalize_svg.py`: whatever you state explicitly is followed, and whatever you leave unspecified the agent decides directly in one active context. It still converts sources, researches factual gaps, applies shared mode/style/aesthetic guidance, prepares required images/icons, authors formulas as native inline or block markers, considers native shapes and data visualizations, hand-authors SVG, passes the lockless Quick final quality check, and exports the final PPTX. It writes no substitute plan and cannot resume after context loss. Formula markers compile their LaTeX payload to editable OMML for PowerPoint 2010+; block groups and inline `<tspan>` runs keep ordinary SVG previews that are replaced during export. Formula rendering and editability in Keynote, WPS, LibreOffice, and other non-PowerPoint clients are not part of this contract. Ordinary export capabilities remain available as needed, including native chart/table replacement, notes, motion, narration, and diagnostics; notes, custom object animation, and narration start off, and the agent may enable them when the request or deck needs them. A default-path Quick export writes the normal postflight report and snapshots `svg_output/` to `backup/<timestamp>/svg_output/`; an explicit output path keeps the ordinary no-backup behavior. By default charts and tables export as individually editable SVG-derived DrawingML shapes, which prioritize cross-app visual consistency. Pass `--native-charts-and-tables` to replace eligible groups with PowerPoint-native Chart/Table objects backed by data, which provide **Edit Data** and object-specific controls but may render differently across apps; this variant is saved as `exports/<name>_<timestamp>_native_charts_tables.pptx`. Both chart/table export variants are editable—the distinction is the PowerPoint object model, not editability itself.

> **Already have a `.pptx` you want to reuse?** Give the AI the deck and material and ask it to "fill this deck with the new content" — Edit Native PPTX keeps the design and unchanged pages byte-for-byte, edits chosen pages, supports selection/reordering, and can add notes or narration. See the [FAQ](./docs/faq.md) and [workflow](./skills/ppt-master/workflows/edit-native-pptx.md).

> **Something went wrong?** If the AI loses context, ask it to read `skills/ppt-master/SKILL.md`; for everything else, check the **[FAQ](./docs/faq.md)** — it covers model selection, layout issues, export problems, and more. Continuously updated from real user reports.

### 5. Image Acquisition (Optional)

Two paths for non-user images, mixable per image in the same deck:

**A) AI generation** — use the agent host's native image tool when available, or `image_gen.py` with `IMAGE_BACKEND` plus the provider's `*_API_KEY`. Host-native generation needs no separate provider image API key; ask the agent to use its own image tool. Run `python3 skills/ppt-master/scripts/image_gen.py --list-backends` for the configured-provider path. `gpt-image-2` is currently the best default.

**B) Web image search** — `image_search.py`. **Zero-config works**; configure `PEXELS_API_KEY` / `PIXABAY_API_KEY` (both free) for consistently higher-quality results:

- Without keys, search uses Openverse / Wikimedia Commons only — useful as a fallback, but image quality can be uneven because many results are ordinary user uploads
- With keys, the default provider chain also appends Pexels / Pixabay, which materially improves modern stock photography, people, workplace, lifestyle, and illustration coverage
- Licensing is handled automatically: CC0, Public Domain, Pexels / Pixabay no-attribution licenses, CC BY, and CC BY-SA are all considered together, and Executor adds a small inline credit whenever the selected image requires attribution. Use `--strict-no-attribution` only when a slide cannot tolerate any credit line
- For high-impact covers, product shots, portraits, and branded scenes, prefer this order: user-provided high-resolution assets / AI generation > web search with Pexels / Pixabay keys > zero-config web search

The API keys above all live in `.env`. Clone installs can use `cp .env.example .env`; skill marketplace installs should use a persistent user config:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ppt-master
cp /path/to/installed/ppt-master/.env.example ~/.ppt-master/.env
```

PPT Master reads the current process environment first, then the first `.env` found in this order: current working directory, skill directory (e.g. `~/.agents/skills/ppt-master/.env`), clone repo root, `~/.ppt-master/.env`.
